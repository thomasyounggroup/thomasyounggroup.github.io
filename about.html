          Thomas Young Group is a specialist headhunting organisation focused on finding the top-level talent within the Building services Sector.
          <br>
          Unlike other broad based recruitment companies, Thomas Young specialises in three distinct disciplines, in order to provide unparalleled expertise and larger candidate networks to our clients - from Graduate to Director level.
          <br><br>
          Our main skill sets cover:
          <br>
          <span class="list">Mechanical | Electrical | Civil</span>
          <br><br>
          With the lack of available talent and the current demand for top-level engineers, our team of specialist recruiters aim to fill the well-documented skills gap within the Building Services sector.
          <br><br>
          We pride ourselves on taking time to fully understand your specifications, in order to identify the most relevant candidates in the market. With this approach we are able to create long lasting relationships with both our clients and our candidates, providing an all-round, highly focused and professional service, unmatched by others.
